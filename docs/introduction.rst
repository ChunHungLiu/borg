About
=====

Modern heuristic solvers can tackle difficult computational problems, but each
solver performs well only on certain tasks. An algorithm portfolio uses
empirical knowledge---past experience of each solver's behavior---to run the
best solvers on each task.

The borg project includes a practical algorithm portfolio for decision
problems, a set of tools for algorithm portfolio development, and a research
platform for the application of statistical models and decision-theoretic
reasoning to the algorithm portfolio setting.
